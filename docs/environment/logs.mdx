<NextSeo description="Learn how to write and read PHP logs on AWS Lambda using Bref." />

# Logs

As explained in the [storage documentation](./storage.mdx), the filesystem on AWS Lambda is:

- read-only, except for `/tmp`
- not shared between lambda instances
- not persistent

Because of that, logs should not be stored on disk.

## CloudWatch

The simplest solution is to push logs to AWS CloudWatch, AWS' service for logs.

### PHP errors and warnings

By default, all PHP errors, warnings and notices emitted by PHP will be forwarded into CloudWatch.

That means that you don't have to configure anything to log errors, warnings or uncaught exceptions.

### Writing logs

Your application can write logs to CloudWatch:

- [With the PHP-FPM runtime for web apps](../runtimes/fpm-runtime.mdx): write logs to `stderr`
- [With the runtime for event-driven functions](../runtimes/function.mdx): write logs to `stdout` (using `echo` for example) or `stderr`

All logs written to `stdout` or `stderr` are automatically be sent to CloudWatch asynchronously by AWS Lambda, **without performance impact on applications**.

        If you use Laravel, Bref will automatically configure Laravel to log to CloudWatch via `stderr`. You don't have to do anything.

        It is recommended you enable Bref's logs formatter optimized for CloudWatch:

        ```yaml filename="serverless.yml"
        provider:
            environment:
                LOG_STDERR_FORMATTER: Bref\Monolog\CloudWatchFormatter
        ```

        <Callout>
            This formatter will be enabled by default in Bref v3.
        </Callout>

        With this formatter, logs will contain structured data that can be filtered in CloudWatch Logs Insights. For example, you can filter by log level, exception class, or anything in the [Laravel Context](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/context).

        If you use Symfony, Bref will automatically configure Symfony to log to CloudWatch via `stderr`. You don't have to do anything.

        It is recommended you enable Bref's logs formatter optimized for CloudWatch, for example:

        ```yaml filename="config/packages/prod/monolog.yaml"
        monolog:
            handlers:
                main:
                    type: stream
                    level: info
                    path: php://stderr
                    formatter: 'Bref\Monolog\CloudWatchFormatter'
        ```

        If you do use that formatter, you also need to declare the service in your `services.yaml` (a pull request in [the Symfony bridge](https://github.com/brefphp/symfony-bridge) to do this automatically is welcome!):

        ```yaml filename="config/services.yaml"
        services:
            Bref\Monolog\CloudWatchFormatter: ~
        ```

        <Callout>
            This formatter will be enabled by default in Bref v3.
        </Callout>

        With this formatter, logs will contain structured data that can be filtered in CloudWatch Logs Insights. For example, you can filter by log level or exception class.
    </Tab>

        You can use [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) to write logs to CloudWatch via `stderr`:

        ```php
        $log = new Monolog\Logger('default');
        $log->pushHandler(new StreamHandler('php://stderr', Logger::INFO));

        $log->warning('This is a warning!');
        ```

        Bref provides a formatter optimized for CloudWatch, it is highly recommended to use it:

        ```bash
        composer require bref/monolog-bridge
        ```

        ```php
        $log = new Monolog\Logger('default');
        $handler = new StreamHandler('php://stderr', Logger::INFO);
        $handler->setFormatter(new Bref\Monolog\CloudWatchFormatter);
        $log->pushHandler($handler);

        $log->warning('This is a warning!');
        ```

        For simple needs, you can replace Monolog with [Bref's logger](https://github.com/brefphp/logger), a PSR-3 logger designed for AWS Lambda:

        ```php
        $log = new \Bref\Logger\StderrLogger();

        $log->warning('This is a warning!');
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Reading logs

To read logs, either open the [CloudWatch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs:) or the [Bref Dashboard](https://dashboard.bref.sh/?ref=bref).

You can also use `serverless logs` to view them in the CLI:

```bash
serverless logs -f <function-name>

# Tail logs:
serverless logs -f <function-name> --tail
```
